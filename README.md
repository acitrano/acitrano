- 👋🏻 Hi, I’m Anthony.
- 👀 I’m a recovering tech founder and lifelong tech nerd.
- 💼 I'm not a developer nor engineer! I live on the business side, particularly in brand and communications 📣.
- 🌱 I’m curious and always learning; that's why I'm here.
- 👨🏼‍🦲 If you need a top-tier communications leader with 20+ years experience from venture-funded startups to a Fortune 15 enterprise, I might be your guy. Learn more about me on [my web site](https://citrano.com).
- 📐 A couple side projects I'm working on:
    - 💵 [The Pluto Project](https://theplutoproject.org), a fun thing I made to track billionaire wealth in real-time (and compare yourself if you dare).
    - 🏛️ Coming soon, maybe: A thing that helps people connect with political candidates they most align with.
